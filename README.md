# craftsociety.dev

Your guess is as good as mine. 
I have the domain, 
a bunch of interest in creating something around it, 
and just enough time to help push it along. push it along. 

if you want to make craftsociety.dev into something with me, 
let me know. Open an issue, dm me, email, it's all there.
